# Eat-da-Burger

This application uses MYSQL along with the use of ORM's to create burgers of any variety, and eat them!  Each burger created has the option of 
being eaten immediately, or saved for later.  All burger's are assigned a value of eaten or uneaten and displayed in the cooresponding area.
Disgustingly, if the user regrets eating the burger, they also have the option to "uneat" the burger. 

Handlebars.js was also used in creating the HTML layout of the page.
